# How To Transition Your Email Away From The Messaging Company

## Introduction

Recently, The Messaging Company (TMC) bought up a bunch of email domains that used to belong to various ISPs. Here are some below:

- @iinet.net.au

- @tpg.com.au

- @internode.on.net

- @adam.com.au

- @netspace.net.au

- @ozemail.com.au

- @pipeline.com.au

- @spin.net.au

- Find out what accounts you need to switch from your old TMC email to a new email

In this tutorial, I'm first going to go over how to download all of your emails and then how to use my custom-made script to filter out the junk and only save the important emails. This script will also make you a list of accounts that you need to switch over to a new email, if you haven't done so already.

## Step #1: Downloading your emails

When I transitioned away from my TMC email, I first had to find a way to download all of my emails. I used Thunderbird, an email app that you can download [here](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/all/).

After downloading Thunderbird and signing in using your TMC email and password, you can then
